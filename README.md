* Stresses you out
* Tells you that good is bad
* Ignore the natural way things work

    * Partial success is considered failure
    * Only big, smooth, perfect wins are acceptable

    * Not enough

### Benefit of Perfectionism (Perceived Safety)
Desire for greatness and fear of inadequacy are counterforces, and perfectionism
is the only solution that *seems* to address both.  **Perfectionism protects us against symbolic failure**:
* **Two Considerations of Failure**
    1. literal impact of failing
    2. meaning and symbolism
        * Why did he/she say "no"?
        * Am I inadequate, unintelligent, etc?
* **Benefits**
    * If you never attempt something, you can't know empirically that you're not world-class at it.
    * Protection from damage to our confidence and hopes
* **Summary**
    * If you can withstand something undesirable AND it strengthens you,
    **you're far better off "unprotected"** against it.
    
### Types of Perfectionists
* Overdriven
    * Never satisfied
    * Unrealistic expectations
    * Rumination
* Paralyzed
    * Fear of failure
    * Concerned about mistakes
    * Doubts about actions
* Both types commonly struggle with the need for acceptance and approval
    * Hiding
    * Extreme effort

### Problems
* Desire versus Reality impairs progress and happiness
* Romanticized
    * good weakness
    * positive flaw
* Superficial
    * actor pretending
    * nobody is perfect
* Personal standards correlated with depression
    * Striving for excellence
    * High expectations
* Self-Handicapping
    * Protection to have an excuse on hand if things don't work out
    * Puts an asterisk beside your failures
    * Playing it safe, instead of playing to win
    * It won't be satisfying at the end of your life
    to have solid excuses for not doing all the things you wanted to do
    * The road to excellence begins unimpressively
        * We subconciously avoid this rocky path through self-handicapping
        * Come up with an excuse for every stumble

### Key XOR (exclusive-OR)
In life, you're consistently building up one of two things:
1. Level of Comfort
2. Level of Growth

### Solutions
* Change what I care about and focus my mind upon
    * Focus on process *not* results
        * Small, consistent, incremental steps
* Change my expectations
